In the Unity game we named “Tank of the Dead”, players control a tank to fight waves of zombies in a large open-world map. The tank moves with the W, A, S, and D keys, which move it forward, left, backward, and right. The mouse controls the turret, allowing players to aim in any direction, and the Spacebar fires the tank’s weapon to destroy zombies. The game has two main modes: level-based mode, where the player completes objectives and survives waves to move to the next level, and infinity mode, where zombies spawn endlessly, challenging the player to survive as long as possible. In level-based mode, each level becomes harder, with the faster zombies to spawn, requiring the player to change their strategy. Infinity mode focuses on survival, with zombies getting tougher and more numerous over time. As the game progresses, the tank will have less health forcing the player to move quicker. 
The game’s dynamics come from how the player uses the controls and adapts to increasing challenges. Moving the tank and aiming with the mouse and keyboard gives the player control but also requires skill, especially when dealing with bigger and faster zombie hordes. In level-based mode, players must manage movement and combat at the same time, avoiding being surrounded by zombies while trying to destroy them. In infinity mode, the difficulty increases as zombies spawn nonstop, so players must manage their limited resources, like health and ammo, while surviving as long as they can. As the waves grow, different types of zombies show up, requiring players to change strategies, such as focusing on movement over firing or using the environment for protection. The harder levels encourage players to keep improving their strategies and skills to stay alive longer. The mix of tank movement, aiming, and resource management keeps the gameplay exciting and engaging.
The game’s visuals help create a tense, immersive atmosphere. The open world has different environments, like cities, forests, and military bases, each with a unique look. The tank is well-designed as a modern T-62 tank. The zombies come in different shapes and sizes, from slow ones to fast, aggressive ones, which makes each wave feel different. In infinity mode, the game gets even more chaotic, with effects like smoke or low light creating a frantic feeling. All these visuals combine to make the game feel more intense and immersive.
Unity’s tools are used to create the large open map and make zombies move realistically. The Animation System ensures smooth movements for both the tank and zombies. The game’s controls are responsive, and it works on both PCs and mobile devices. These technologies work together to create a seamless and enjoyable gameplay experience with smooth transitions between levels and game modes.
We are basing this game off of the two games Space Schmup and Dungeon Delver with the use of some of the code with certain movements and number of enemies. Dungeon Delver helped us with the idea of level based settings. Space Schmup ideas were sparked with its use of the amount of enemy ships that come, only difference is the directional enemies and the point of view.
